# TamaFit

Current state:

TamaFit is a full stack web application that will track a user's workout history and display an avatar of their choice. Users can view/edit their logs, update their avatars and compare how many logs other users have in total.

Original concept:

TamaFit is a full stack web application that will track a user's workout history and display an avatar that is a direct visual representation of how much hard work (or lack thereof) the user is doing. The user will create an account and begin to add data about the type of workout they completed and the date they completed it on. The app will use the data to display how the workouts are affecting the user by displaying a happy avatar or an unhappy avatar based on their workout history.

### Technical Approach

Tamafit was intended to be a very amitious app with lots of features to track a users health and display this data in a fun and interactive manner. Setting up the database and joining all of the user data together was difficult, we used sequelize to deal with this which made the process smoother. Managing the login info for each user was also a difficult process. Our team used bcrypt to encrypt the users password.
